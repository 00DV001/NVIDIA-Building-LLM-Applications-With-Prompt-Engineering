                    The title of the largest dinosaur to have ever existed is held by **Argentinosaurus**. 
                    **Meet the Argentinosaurus**
                    Estimated length:** 30-35 meters (100-115 feet)
                    Estimated weight: 80-100 tons (180,000-220,000 pounds)
                    Argentinosaurus was a **Sauropod**, a long-necked, herbivorous dinosaur that roamed the Earth during the Late Cretaceous period, around 95-100 million years ago. It was a massive creature, even larger than the famous Longos and Blue s.
                    Imagine an animal as long as a 12-story building, with a weight equivalent to around 25 elephants! That's what this incredible creature must have looked like.
                    **Fascinating facts about Argentinosaurus:**
                    *   It was a bottom-dwellers, living in a wet, low-lying area with abundant vegetation.
                    *   Its enormous body supported 4 massive legs and a long tail, which may have made it a surprisingly efficient runner.
                    *   Its brain was quite small compared to its size, possibly just the size of a baseball.
                    *   Its fossils show signs of severe pathological issues, such as advanced age-related decay and immense bone pathology.
                    **Why is the Argentinosaurus so impressive?**
                    The sheer size of the Argentinosaurus leaves no doubt that it was a truly monstrous creature, and its track record has garnered much acclaim as the largest known dinosaur to date. Scientists and paleontologists are still trying to unravel the mystery of this massive plant-eater.
                    The Argentinosaurus is now offered on top of the dinosaur summit, showcasing just how astronomical the diversity and grandeur of these creatures truly are.

model_response5 = 'Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for 
                    various purposes, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Here are some of the key features of Python:
                    **Key Features of Python:**
                    1.  **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to read and write, making it a great language for beginners.
                    2.  **High-level Language**: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of the program.
                    3.  **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
                    4.  **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks**: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform various tasks, such as data analysis, web development, and more.

prompt7 = 'Generate an image of a penguin   '
result = llm.invoke(prompt7)
print(result.content)
Unfortunately, I'm a text-based AI and cannot generate images. However, I can describe a penguin to you:

**A penguin stands on the icy shore, its black and white feathers glistening in the sunlight. Its tuxedo-like feathers are perfectly symmetrical, with a crisp white belly and a sleek black back. The penguin's beak is short and stout, and its eyes are a bright, inquisitive brown. It stands proudly, its flippers folded against its sides, as if ready to dive into the icy waters at any moment.**

If you'd like, I can also try to create a simple ASCII art penguin for you:
